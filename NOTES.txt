    application/config/config.php               
        - Defines constants, like MySQL login info
        - Also defines URL constant

    also ↓
    core/application.php
        - This splits the URL like this:
            ↓URL              /↓ controller/home.php  /↓ deleteSticky() in home.php  /↓ passes (23) to deleteSticky
            www.fishpond.com  /home                   /deletesticky                  /23

    also ↓
    core/controller.php
        - Creates new database connection object and passes it into model/model.php


/**
* To Do
*/

Maybe rename all the $storeData variables to something without the word store in it?

Make some MySQL database & table starters for fresh installs.

Make documentation comments.

Make contact action and contact options dropdowns populate their options from entries in the data.json file, instead of being hard-coded into the HTML.
