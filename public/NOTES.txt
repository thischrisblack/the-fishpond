    application/config/config.php               
        - Defines constants, like MySQL login info
        - Also defines URL constant

    also ↓
    core/application.php
        - This splits the URL like this:
            ↓URL              /↓ controller/home.php  /↓ deleteSticky() in home.php  /↓ passes (23) to deleteSticky
            www.fishpond.com  /home                   /deletesticky                  /23

    also ↓
    core/controller.php
        - Creates new database connection object and passes it into model/model.php


/**
* To Do

Maybe rename all the $storeData variables to something without the word store in it?

Make some MySQL database & table starters for fresh installs.

HEY I think I can make the action-options dropdowns automatically fill in by reading the data.json file. For example, the email dropdown could look for all "email-*" keys in the JSON file, and build them from there.

HEY I think I can do the same thing with the options in the main action dropdown. Add them and their values to the JSON.
