# THE FISHPOND

This is a contact-management app for retail stores who use the AIMsi P.O.S. system AND do their own collections on delinquent rental accounts. If that's you, this is your lucky day!

This was built upon panique's [MINI, an extremely simple barebone PHP application](http://www.dev-metal.com/mini-extremely-simple-barebone-php-application/).

This app has no documentation right now! That's to do.
